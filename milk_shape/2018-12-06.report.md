Matthew Lange presented the notion of a "food phenotype"
under development in the context of the [IC-FOODS
project](http://www.ic-foods.org).

A food phenotype consists of chemical and biological
properties, culinary structure (physical structure made
not necessarily by biological processes, such as a sheet
of pasta), and organoleptic properties -- things such as
aroma, flavor, taste, smell, sound, and bioactive
components.  The food phenotype is useful in modeling the
processes around producing, transformiing, distributing,
and consuming food.  The project wants to annotate foods
with regard to their phenotype while recognizing that
food is constantly morphing throughout these processes.

The hackathon table had originally set out to describe
the phenotype of lasagne [1] on the assumption that
lasagne, with its multiple ingredients, layered
construction, and physiological characteristics, was
suitably complex as a food, such that if we could
describe lasagne, we could in principle describe
anything.

However, we soon agreed to describe the ultimate human
food, mammalian milk: to define a Milk Shape specifying
the set of properties usable for describing a sample of
milk.

Given the limited time available, it was proposed that
the exercise look at milk from the standpoint of
questions asked in, for example, a scientific experiment, 
and proceed as follows:

1. Start with the description of a sample of milk, in
   Turtle.
2. Generalize the example description into a ShEx schema.
3. Factor out distinct shapes for various facets of the 
   milk sample, such as an Aroma Shape. 
4. Test the schema by validating the description(s).

In the end, we started with Step 2 by having Matthew
enumerate a [set of key-value
pairs](https://github.com/IC-FOODS/FoodShapes/blob/master/milk_shape/milk.md)
potentially useful for capturing information about a
sample of milk.

### ShEx schema: first iteration 

The [first-cut ShEx
schema](https://github.com/IC-FOODS/FoodShapes/blob/master/milk_shape/milk.shex)
is a literal translation of the first half of Matthew's
full set of properties: everything through Organoleptic
Properties, with placeholders for Physical Properties and
(for now) omitting Chemical Components.

This schema matches
[data](https://github.com/IC-FOODS/FoodShapes/blob/master/milk_shape/milk-data.ttl)
that uses a property, `:organolepticProperties`, with as
its value a blank node which, in turn, has properties
such as `:sweetness`.

```
<s>
  :sampleID "asdf" ;
  :sourceOrganism [
    :genus "bos";
    :species "taurus"
  ];
  :organolepticProperties [
    :aroma "nasal appearance";
    :taste [
      :sweetness 5.0 ;
      :sourness 5.0 ;
      :bitterness 5.0 ;
      :saltiness 5.0 ;
      :umami 5.0
    ]
  ]
```

### ShEx schema: second iteration 

The [second-cut ShEx
schema](https://github.com/IC-FOODS/FoodShapes/blob/master/milk_shape/milk2.shex)
is like the first, except it factors out the organoleptic 
properties into a separate shape `<:OrganolepticShape>`, 
to match the same data as `milk.shex`.

### ShEx schema: third iteration 

The [third-cut ShEx
schema](https://github.com/IC-FOODS/FoodShapes/blob/master/milk_shape/milk3.shex)
dispenses with the special property
`:organolepticProperties` so that properties like
`:aroma` and `:taste` are modeled directly as properties
of the milk sample in the
[data](https://github.com/IC-FOODS/FoodShapes/blob/master/milk_shape/milk-data3.ttl).

```
<s>
  :sampleID "asdf" ;
  :sourceOrganism [
    :genus "bos";
    :species "taurus"
  ];
  :aroma "nasal appearance";
  :taste [
    :sweetness 5.0 ;
    :sourness 5.0 ;
    :bitterness 5.0 ;
    :saltiness 5.0 ;
    :umami 5.0
  ]
.
```

It does this by declaring a 
[reusable set of triple constraints](http://shex.io/shex-primer/#labeled-constraints)
with a dollar-sign-prefixed label, `$:organoleptic`, and
including that set of constraints in the main shape,
`<:MilkSample>`, by citing the label with an ampersand
prefix `&:organoleptic` as follows:

```
<:MilkSample> {
    &:organoleptic ;
}
```

It is worth noting that ShEx 2.2 is on track to have a 
new capability, `EXTENDS`, which will allow such named,
reusable sets of triple constraints to live on an
external server.
