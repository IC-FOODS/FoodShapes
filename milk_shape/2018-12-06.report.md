Matthew Lange presented the notion of a "food phenotype"
under development in the [IC-FOODS
project](http://www.ic-foods.org).

A food phenotype consists of chemical and biological properties, culinary structure (physical structure not necessarily made by biological processes, such as a sheet of pasta), and organoleptic properties -- things such as aroma, flavor, taste, smell, sound, and bioactive components.  The food phenotype is useful in modeling the processes around producing, transformiing, distributing, and consuming food.  The project wants to annotate foods with regard to their phenotype while recognizing that food is constantly morphing throughout these processes.

The [hackathon pitch](https://github.com/IC-FOODS/FoodShapes/blob/master/milk_shape/2018-12-06.hackathon_pitch.md) originally proposed to describe the phenotype of lasagne on the assumption that lasagne, with its multiple ingredients, layered construction, and physiological characteristics, was suitably complex as a food, such that if we could describe lasagne, we could in principle describe any food.  However, we decided instead to describe mammalian milk -- to define a Milk Shape specifying the set of properties usable for describing a sample of milk.

Given the limited time available, it was proposed that we look at milk from the standpoint of questions asked in, for example, a scientific experiment, and proceed as follows:

1. Start with the description of a sample of milk, in Turtle.
2. Generalize the example description into a ShEx schema.
3. Factor out distinct shapes for various facets of the milk sample, such as an Aroma Shape. 
4. Test the schema by validating the description(s).
5. Flesh out the schema and data by incrementally adding properties to meet new use cases.

In the end, we began by having Matthew enumerate a reasonably complete [set of key-value pairs](https://github.com/IC-FOODS/FoodShapes/blob/master/milk_shape/milk.md) potentially useful for capturing information about a sample of milk, used that to create the schema, and made up some hypothetical data to match.  (Some terms were taken from a [draft milk ontology](https://github.com/IC-FOODS/uc_Milk).)

#### [Data about a hypothetical milk sample](https://github.com/IC-FOODS/FoodShapes/blob/master/milk_shape/milk-data.ttl)

Disclaimer: We made some effort to use plausible units for quantitative values but made no effort to assign plausible values ("999" for most).

### Data design - discussion

After Matthew left to catch a train, we had to guess whether the headings "Organoleptic properties" and "Physical properties" were intended simply to group sets of milk sample properties or were actually meant themselves to be properties, taking object values to which the specific organoleptic and physical properties would attach.

```
- SampleID
- Source organism
    - Genus
    - Species
- Organoleptic properties
    - Texture 
    - Mouth Feel
    - Taste
        - Sweetness
        - Sourness ...
- Physical properties
    - Density
    - Freezing Point ...
```

For the sake of demonstration, the sample data reflects both modeling choices:
* "physiological properties" is modeled as a property taking a blank node as value which, in turn, is the subject of triples for density, freezing point, and the like.
* the organoleptic properties, on the other hand, are modeled directly as properties of the milk sample.

Note that "color" appears twice: once as a (subjective) organoleptic property, and once as an (objective) physiological property.

### Schema design

```
<#MilkSample> {
  :sampleID xsd:string ;
  :sourceOrganism {
    :genus xsd:string ;
    :species xsd:string ;
  } ;
  :physicalProperties @<#PhysicalProperties> ;
  &<#organolepticProperties> ;
}
```

Note that the primary shape of interest, `<#MilkSample>`, illustrates several ShEx schema design possibilities:
* properties directly of the milk sample
  * `:sampleID`, which takes a string value.
  * `:sourceOrganism`, which takes a blank node which, in turn, has the properties `:genus` and `:species`.
  * five organoleptic properties, which are incorporated into the milk shape by referencing a [labeled triple expression](http://shex.io/shex-primer/#labeled-constraints).
* properties indirectly of the milk sample:
  * the eight physical properties as described in the shape `<#PhysicalProperties>`, itself the object of the property `:physicalProperties`.

It is worth noting that ShEx 2.2 is on track to have a new capability, `EXTENDS`, which will allow named, reusable sets of triple constraints to be referenced and imported by URI.

Note that in principle, the taste, visual appearance, and color properties could also have been referenced and imported as properties directly of the milk sample rather than by way of the object of the properties `:taste`, `:visualAppearance`, and `:color`.
  
### Validating the data

The data and schema are referenced in a [ShEx manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IC-FOODS/FoodShapes/master/milk_shape/manifest.json), which can be manually loaded into the [online ShEx validator](https://rawgit.com/shexSpec/shex.js/master/doc/shex-simple.html) by clicking on "Controls" => "Load Manifest". 

See data validated against the schema:
* click on http://bit.ly/milk_shape_validation (shortened permalink for the manifest).
* click on `Got milk?` to load the schema.
* click on `and cookies` to load the data.
* click on `validate` to run the validation.

Note that the data and schema can be edited directly in the online validator and tested there (though you will need to save your work separately!).
