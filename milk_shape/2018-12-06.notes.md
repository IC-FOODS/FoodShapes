ML: Notion of "food phenotype".  (We'll deal with packaging later.)  Food has:
* chemical
* biological 
* culinary structure - physical structure made not necessarily by biological processes (sheet of pasta)
* (Organoleptic) - derived properties - things that would be altered by the above
    * Aroma
    * Flavour
    * Taste
    * Smell
    * Sound
    * Bioactive components like:
        * Probiotics - used to feed gut bacteria

Food Phenotype - processes we can model
* Production
* Transformation
* Distribution (storage)
* Consumption (you eat it)

Then:
* Actors
* Issues

We want to annotate foods, but also recognise that food is constantly morphing.

Nutrician has moved from 'eat vitamin c to avoid scurvy' to understanding the bioactivity that will help with health

## What would we capture about milk

- components
  - fat globules
  - fat globule member
- anes
- proteins broken down into bioactive peptides

Goal: A Milk Shape specifying the set of properties usable to describe a sample of milk.

Method:
* Start with a description of a sample of milk, in Turtle, and turn it into a ShEx schema.
* Factor out other, related shapes, such as an Aroma Shape. Can reference preliminary uc_Milk ontology:

See NPJ paper:

## What are the key value pairs needed to capture information about a sample of milk?
- SampleID
- Source Organism (uses NCBI taxonomy)-- 
    - Genus eg bos
    - Species eg taurus
- Organoleptic properties
    - Aroma (the "nasal appearance"): multiple terms from a controlled vocabulary (uses UC_Sense perceived Odor) 
        - can be multiple aromas
        - e.g. perceived butterscotch odor, perceived burnt odor
    - Taste: all characteristics might not be present but there are no other properties can be multiple values from:
        - Sweetness: as per a scale
        - Sourness: as per a scale
        - Bitterness: as per a scale
        - Saltiness: as per a scale
        - Umami: as per a scale
    - Texture: controlled vocabulary from uc_Sense perceived_Texture:  
    - Mouth Feel: controlled vocabulary from uc_Sense perceived_Mouthfeel e.g. perceived chewiness, perceived astringency
    - VisualAppearance:
        - Color
        - Opaqueness
- Physical properties:
    - Density
    - Freezing Point
    - Acid-base Equilibria
    - Viscosity
    - Volume
    - Optical Properties
        - Color: what wavelengths (spectrometer reading)
        -Absorbance:
    - Temperature
- Chemical Components:
    - Molecules (classes of molecules)
        - Lipids 
        - Carbohydrates:
            - total carbohydrates 
                - value and unit e.g. 2 grams
            - individual carbohydrates 
                - sequence string, value, and units from https://tinyurl.com/yaxhwygf
        - Free amino acids
        - Peptides: sequence string and amount value, and unit 
        - e.g. from values at https://tinyurl.com/yaxhwygf
            - 
        - 
    - phValue value as per pH scale
    - Xenobiotics
- Biological Components:
    - Microbiological

## What are the questions that we would like to be able to answer over this data?

  * TODO

## Molecular entity properties
  * accession (and source it refers to)
  * prefName, altName
  * description
  * organism (in particular, NCBITax ID)
  * provenance (URI or string)

### Properties from gene, protein
  * sequence, chromosome, begin, end

### Relations to other entities
  * ontology annotation/xref (GO, trait ontology, phenotype ontology)
  * associated with
  * encodes
  * part-of (eg, pathway, molecular complex)
  * input-of/output-of (eg, reaction, pathway)
