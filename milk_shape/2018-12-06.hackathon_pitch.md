Writing Shape Expressions for Lasagne

Drivers: Matthew Lange, Eric Prudâ€™hommeaux, Tom Baker,
Egon Willighagen, Andra Waagmeester

Introduction.  Shape Expressions provide a powerful way
to describe linked data sets. In this hackathon we will
focus on food, specifically lasagna.

Aim.  To create an initial collection of Shape
Expressions to describe food phenotypes, the processes
that produce and transform their ingredients, and the
machines/people that engage in these processes.

Prerequisite: Knowledge on food and agriculture data sets
(recommended but not required). Having prepared, eaten or
smelled lasagna.

Expected results: Cooking up seed corpus of Shape
Expressions by modeling lasagna. Providing some of the
food linked data landscape, and serving as a nucleation
site for further schema curation.
